Major features
--------------

* Authentication
* Reversion
* Kinship system
* Registration
* Comments
* Tagging/issue tracking system (maybe integrated with comment system, but
  probably not)

Minor features
--------------

* Backup system (crude version complete)
* Nexus output (basic version complete)
* CSV output (wait until there's a call for it)
* Editing membership of named lists

Refactoring
-----------

Concrete

* stacks of ``elif``

  change to::

    actions = {"action1":action1,
              "action2":action2}
    actions["action1"](request, **kwargs)

* boilerplate code::

    if request.method == "POST":
        <handle repeat visit>
    else:
        <handle first visit>

* use named urls throughout?

General 

* DNRY violations:

  - cancel button handling
  - fixing type of integer url elements

* functions are too long

* is it possible to wrap button functions in an html snippet
