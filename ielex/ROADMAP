Refactoring
-----------

Concrete

* stacks of ``elif``

  change to::

    actions = {"action1":action1,
              "action2":action2}
    actions["action1"](request, **kwargs)

* boilerplate code::

    if request.method == "POST":
        <handle repeat visit>
    else:
        <handle first visit>

* use named urls throughout?

General 

* DNRY violations:

  - cancel button handling
  - fixing type of integer url elements

* functions are too long
