TODO
====

- Check that the same alias isn't used twice for different cognates, same
  meaning (e.g. in the 'breathe/life' and 'animal' sets). Maybe: dynamically
  check that the list of aliases corresponds uniquely to a list of cognate
  sets, and apply a new alias to one of the forms (would have to check against
  the aliases used by the other meanings corresponding to the form as well).

- put some kind of icon for "reliability" against cognate aliases and lexemes

- test what happens when you change a language name (does the data get lost)

- Use http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-management-commands/ to
  make database-specific management functions (e.g. add users, dump data,
  change superuser password, etc)
