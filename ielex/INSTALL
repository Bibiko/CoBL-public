Dependencies:

  * Recent Django (tested on 1.3)

  * Recent ``reversion`` middleware (``easy_install django-reversion``;
    currently using 1.4)

  * The ``south`` schema migration package (``easy_install South``; currently
    using 0.7.4)

  * If you're going to do any work on the code, it is useful to install
    ``debug_toolbar`` (``easy_install django-debug-toolbar``). If debug toolbar
    is available it will be activated when ``DEBUG`` is set to ``True`` in the
    local_settings.py file; see below.
  
After a clean install, 

  * Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` and add superuser when prompted (this will
    copy ``local_settings.py.dist`` to ``local_settings.py`` and generate a
    secret key)

  * Customize ``local_settings.py`` with name of database etc.

  * Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to update all the database schemas etc to
    the most current version

  * If you want to test the database, download ``dravidian_wordlists.json``
    from the BitBucket site, and run::
    
      python manage.py loaddata dravidian_wordlists.json

**TODO**

  - prepare and upload the sample wordlists.
