Dependencies:

  * Recent Django (tested on 1.2.3)

  * Recent ``reversion`` middleware (``easy_install django-reversion``;
    currently using 1.3.2)
  
After a clean install, 

  * Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` and add superuser when prompted (this will
    copy ``local_settings.py.dist`` to ``local_settings.py`` and generate a
    secret key)

  * Customize ``local_settings.py`` with name of database etc.

To get it going with ``south`` for the first time (i.e. *not* a clean install)

 1. Make sure 'south' is in the INSTALLED_APPS setting.
 2. Run ./manage.py syncdb

You then need to run the following two commands to complete the
migration:

   ./manage.py migrate reversion 0001 --fake
   ./manage.py migrate lexicon 0001 --fake
   ./manage.py migrate semantic_extension 0001 --fake
   ./manage.py migrate --no-initial-data
