LexDB is a lexical cognate tracking database. It stores the full provenance of
all lexemes and cognate judgements, and allows export into a number of nexus
dialects. The database is written in the flexible python/django web framework.

LexDB is used for the Indo-European Lexical Database (IELex) at
http://ielex.mpi.nl. For more information please see the project wiki
(https://bitbucket.org/evoling/lexdb/wiki/Home) on the BitBucket development
site (https://bitbucket.org/evoling/lexdb).

For installation details and sample data see the wiki (https://bitbucket.org/evoling/lexdb/wiki/Home).
