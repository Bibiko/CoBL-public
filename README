LexDB is a lexical cognate tracking database. It stores the full provenance of
all lexemes and cognate judgements, and allows export into a number of nexus
dialects. The database is written in the flexible python/django web framework.

LexDB is used for the [[http://ielex.mpi.nl|Indo-European Lexical Database 
(IELex)]]. For more information please see
